# Hey, i'm Yuri Peixinho 💻🐟

I've been working as a full-stack developer since 2021. I focus mainly on integrating scalable project interfaces with JavaScript, ReactJS and SASS, in addition, I have experience developing API's in micro services using Python-Flask and MYSQL. In my free time, I act as the owner of the organization Diosonic together with my twin brother to improve my knowledge in project management, backend and devops. Come and see some of my aquarium!
